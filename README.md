# Covid 19 Web Map Applications

<p> In this project I created two web map applications representing both the total Covid 19<br>
    cases throughout the United States in the year 2020, as well as the overall rates between<br>
    positive cases and number of deaths.

<p> This choropleth map focuses on the U.S. Covid rates. The maps primary functions offer the ability<br>
    to hover over individual counties to view their specific rates.</p>

<p> This proportional symbols map focuses on the U.S. Covid cases. The maps primary functions offer<br>
    the ability to click on dots and view the exact number of cases in the area. </p>

<p> The Covid 19 case/death data was collected from <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/43d32dde2f87bd4dafbb7d23f5d9e878124018b8/live/us-counties.csv"> The New York Times</a>
    The data includes all cases in the year 2020.<br>
    The population data used for calculating the case rates are from the <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0100000US%24050000&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true"> 2018 ACS 5 year estimates.</a> The shapefiles used<br>
    for the map was downloaded from <a href="https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html"> the U.S. Census Bureau</a>.</p>
